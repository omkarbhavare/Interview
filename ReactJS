1. What is React and why use it?
  React.js is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs). It follows a component-based architecture, which promotes code reusability and modularity. React uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update and render the UI, making it faster compared to direct DOM manipulation. It also uses JSX, which allows writing HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript, making the code more readable. With its unidirectional data flow, React ensures predictable state management, making applications easier to debug and maintain.
